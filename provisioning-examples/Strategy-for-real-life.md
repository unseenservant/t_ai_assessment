# Strategy for Real Life

## Diverse Deployment Environments

In real-world scenarios, we'd be targeting Kubernetes clusters across multiple infrastructure types:
- Public cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- On-premises data centers
- Bare-metal deployments

Cookie-cutter GitHub Actions workflows would be insufficient for this diversity. Each environment has unique networking configurations, security requirements, and authentication mechanisms that require customized deployment approaches.

## GitOps Operators: Benefits and Limitations

For many cloud and modern on-premises environments, CD operators like Flux or ArgoCD offer significant advantages:
- Declarative infrastructure management
- Automated reconciliation and drift detection
- Robust audit trails through Git history

However, this approach is not universally suitable:
- Legacy environments may lack Kubernetes API access from external sources
- High-security environments may restrict outbound network connectivity
- Some customers may have specific compliance requirements prohibiting automated changes

## Pull-Based Deployment Model

Given our customers' diverse environmental and authentication requirements, along with varying upgrade cadences, we recommend adopting a CD operator that accommodates a pull-based model:

- Customers control when updates are applied to their environments
- Updates can be tested in staging environments before production deployment
- Supports air-gapped environments where outbound connectivity is restricted
- Allows customers to maintain their own deployment schedules based on business requirements
- Can integrate with existing change management and approval workflows

## Unified Monitoring and Reporting

Our deployment architecture must include robust monitoring and reporting capabilities:

- Customer-togglable telemetry collection
- Segregated data storage to ensure customer data security
- Unified metrics collection regardless of deployment environment
- Customizable alerting thresholds based on customer requirements
- Integration with existing customer monitoring solutions
- Compliance with data sovereignty and privacy regulations

This approach allows us to maintain visibility into application health while respecting customer security requirements and ensuring proper data segregation.
